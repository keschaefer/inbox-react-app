# React Inbox

Replicated a gmail look-alike inbox with React. Users can:

* mark messages as read/unread
* add labels to messages
* compose new message
* select/deselect messages
* star/unstar messages

**Note: this site requires access to my personal, altertered "collective-api" to function properly particularly for select/deselect functionality"
